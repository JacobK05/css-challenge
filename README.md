# Jacob Kaufenberg's Portfolio

## Discription

As a up and coming developer I need a way to show my skills. The portfolio that I made is a live web browser the allows employers to see what projects ive completed. Giving the employer the best incite on who I am and how I complete my work. This Portfolio fixed the problem of me not being able to show off my work and skills to get the job I'm worth. I learned I need to set more time aside because I underestimated the time it would to take to complete this challenge.
